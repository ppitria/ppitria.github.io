# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Pitriani
Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio** â€” a personal space where I document my learning journey and share projects Iâ€™ve created to improve my data skills.

## About Me
Iâ€™m a fresh graduate majoring in Informatics Engineering with a growing interest in **Data Analytics**.  
Iâ€™m currently learning to explore and analyze data using Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau by building small projects to deepen my understanding.
